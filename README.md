3.	Update/Add, Stage and Commit changes to the branch.
4.	(Optional) Branch can be pushed to remote during work process.
    1.	Enables team members to view the branch progress
    2.	Good if two or more members are working within together within the branch.
5.	When work is completed, checkout to master remote and pull from server.
6.	Merge master local into your branch local.
