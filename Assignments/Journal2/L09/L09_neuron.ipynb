    "Neurons sends messages throughout the body to do actions with electrical and chemical signals. It starts as an electrical signal travelling down a neuron which is called an action potential.<br>\n",
    "When the messages reaches the gap, also called the synapse, between two neurons they need help to get across. This is where the action potential transform into a chemical message.<br>\n",
    "With repeated activity, the synapse gets stronger so the next message is more likely to get through. This way the neurons learn to pass important messages and ignore the rest, which is how our brains learn and adapts every day.\n",

    "Cognition is a significant part of our daily activities and every day the human brain utilizes this mental action. The way we eat, speak and do so many other things is due to cognition. A simple task such as eating an apple, may in reality be very complex, because our brain processes this and as humans we tend to not pay attention to these simple tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, cognition is basically signals whenever our brain gets activated to do a certain action. For example being afraid of heights signals the brain and tells the body that the current action is dangerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "However for engineers working with machine learning, the more interesting question is: **How can we implement these functions into algorithms?**. Because if we are able to break these functions into algorithms, we may be able to code it into a machine and perhaps the machine will be able to have senses comparable with humans, such as being afraid of heights."
